                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IIT Jodhpur is dedicated to promote technology thought and action. IIT Jodhpur is making live improvements
                        in its degree programs – especially in curriculum and laboratory. The Institute is making conscious efforts towards preparing the needed
                        competent technical human resources, who will help meet the technology challenges of the nation. Specifically, the Institute
                        is launching a major move towards holistic development of its Students. Competence involves three facets – positive Attitude,
                        needed Skills and deep Knowledge. While the academic degree programs target the latter two facets, an extra and special effort
                        is needed for improving the Attitude; this is the new challenge of the Institute. Therefore, the current focus of the Institute
                        on Student Placements is being changed to one on Student Career Development; the five tracks of work of this new office will
                        be: (1) Career Planning, (2) Soft-skill Enhancement, (3) Placement Process, (4) Industry Relations, and (5) Alumni Engagement.
                        With this renewed focus, the Institute will work towards making Students possess positive Attitude in addition to the needed
                        Skills and deep Knowledge.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this year, IIT Jodhpur is further equipping its teaching laboratories. Also, the Department of Metallurgical
                        &amp; Materials Engineering is starting the M.Tech and Ph.D. Degree Programs, and the Department of Bioscience &amp; Bioengineering the B.Tech.
                        Degree Program. These new programs and the ongoing ones will offer foundation to advanced level courses, with emphasis on
                        hands-on learning. Further, the Institute is continuous efforts to strengthen its relations with technology industries; its
                        Industry Immersion Program gives select students industrial exposure to live end-to-end technology.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that in the years to come, the principal stakeholders of the Institute work harder and
                        in unison with constructive thoughts... and prepare its graduates to be more competent with each year passing. I invite Technology &amp; Other Industries,
                        R & D organizations and Academia to partner in building this relatively young Institute, through mentoring our technology
                        education programs and projects, and considering employing our graduates in the years to come…
